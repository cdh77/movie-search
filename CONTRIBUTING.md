### Issue and Pull Request Labels
This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests. Most labels are used across all Film Finder repositories, but some are specific to cdh77/movie-search.

GitHub search makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in. For example, you might be interested in open issues across cdh77/movie-search and packages which are labeled as bugs, but still need to be reliably reproduced or perhaps open pull requests in cdh77/movie-search which haven't been reviewed yet. To help you find issues and pull requests, each label is listed with search links for finding open items with that label in cdh77/movie-search only.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue on cdh77/movie-search if you have suggestions for new labels, and if you notice some labels are missing on some repositories, then please open an issue on that repository.
